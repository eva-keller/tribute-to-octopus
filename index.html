        The octopus (plural octopuses) is a soft-bodied, eight-limbed mollusc of the order Octopoda (/ɒkˈtɒpədə/, ok-TO-pə-də).
        Around 300 species are recognised, and the order is grouped within the class Cephalopoda with squids, cuttlefish, 
        and nautiloids. Like other cephalopods, the octopus is bilaterally symmetric with two eyes and a beak, with its mouth 
        Arat the center point of the eight limbs.</p> 
        <p>The soft body can rapidly alter its shape, enabling octopuses to squeeze 
        through small gaps. They trail their eight appendages behind them as they swim. The siphon is used both for respiration 
        and for locomotion, by expelling a jet of water. Octopuses have a complex nervous system and excellent sight, and are 
        among the most intelligent and behaviourally diverse of all invertebrates.</p>

        <p>Octopuses inhabit various regions of the ocean, including coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the seabed; some live in 
        the intertidal zone and others at abyssal depths. Most species grow quickly, mature early, and are short-lived. In 
        most species, the male uses a specially adapted arm to deliver a bundle of sperm directly into the female's mantle 
        cavity, after which he becomes senescent and dies, while the female deposits fertilised eggs in a den and cares for 
        them until they hatch, after which she also dies.</p>
        <p>Strategies to defend themselves against predators include the 
        expulsion of ink, the use of camouflage and threat displays, the ability to jet quickly through the water and hide, 
        and even deceit. All octopuses are venomous, but only the blue-ringed octopuses are known to be deadly to humans.</p>

        <p>Octopuses appear in mythology as sea monsters like the Kraken of Norway and the Akkorokamui of the Ainu, and probably 
        the Gorgon of ancient Greece. A battle with an octopus appears in Victor Hugo's book Toilers of the Sea, inspiring 
        other works such as Ian Fleming's Octopussy. Octopuses appear in Japanese erotic art, shunga. They are eaten and 
        considered a delicacy by humans in many parts of the world, especially the Mediterranean and the Asian seas.
